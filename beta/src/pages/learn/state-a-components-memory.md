<Intro>

组件通常需要根据交互更改屏幕上显示的内容。输入表单应该更新输入字段，单击图片轮播上的“下一个”应该更改显示的图片，单击“购买”应该将商品放入购物车。组件需要“记住”某些东西：当前输入值、当前图片、购物车。在 React 中，这种组件特有的记忆被称为 **state**。

## When a regular variable isn’t enough

以下是一个渲染雕塑图片的组件。点击“下一个”按钮应该显示下一个雕塑并将 `index` 更改为 `1`，再次点击又更改为 `2`，以此类推。但这个组件现在**不起作用**（你可以试一试！）：

<Sandpack>

```js
import { sculptureList } from './data.js';

export default function Gallery() {
  let index = 0;

  function handleClick() {
    index = index + 1;
  }

  let sculpture = sculptureList[index];
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>
        Next
      </button>
      <h2>
        <i>{sculpture.name} </i>

`handleClick()` 事件处理函数正在更新局部变量 `index`。但是有两件事阻止了我们看到变化：
The `handleClick()` event handler is updating a local variable, `index`. But two things prevent that change from being visible:

1. **局部变量无法在多次渲染中持久保存。** 当 React 第二次渲染这个组件时，它会从头开始渲染——不考虑对局部变量的任何更改。
2. **对局部变量的更改不会触发渲染。** React 没有意识到它需要使用新数据再次渲染组件。

要使用新数据更新组件，需要做两件事：

1. **保留**渲染之间的数据。
2. **触发** React 使用新数据渲染组件（重新渲染）。

[`useState`](/reference/usestate) Hook 提供了这两个功能：

1. **State 变量** 用于保留渲染之间的数据。
2. **State setter 函数** 更新变量并触发 React 再次渲染组件。
1. A **state variable** to retain the data between renders.

## Adding a state variable

要添加 state 变量，请从文件顶部的 React 导入 `useState`：
To add a state variable, import `useState` from React at the top of the file:

```js
import { useState } from 'react';
```

然后，替换掉这一行：

```js
let index = 0;
```

修改为

```js
const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);
```

`index` 是一个 state 变量，`setIndex` 是对应的 setter 函数。


> 这里的 `[` 和 `]` 语法称为[数组解构](/learn/a-javascript-refresher#array-destructuring)，它允许你从数组中读取值。 `useState` 返回的数组总是正好有两个项。

以下展示了它们在 `handleClick()` 中是如何共同起作用的：

```js
function handleClick() {
  setIndex(index + 1);
}
```

现在点击“下一个”按钮切换当前雕塑：

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState } from 'react';
import { sculptureList } from './data.js';

export default function Gallery() {
  const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);

  function handleClick() {
    setIndex(index + 1);
  }

  let sculpture = sculptureList[index];
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>
        Next
      </button>
      <h2>

### Meet your first Hook

在 React 中，`useState` 以及任何其他以“`use`”开头的函数都被称为 **Hook**。

Hooks 是特殊的函数，只有在 React [渲染](/learn/render-and-commit#step-1-trigger-a-render)时才可用（我们将在下一节详细介绍）。它们能让你“hook”到不同的 React 特性中去。
Hooks are special functions that are only available while React is [rendering](/learn/render-and-commit#step-1-trigger-a-render) (which we'll get into in more detail on the next page). They let you "hook into" different React features.

State 只是这些特性中的一个，你之后还会遇到其他 Hooks。

<Gotcha>

**Hooks——以`use`开头的函数——只能在组件或[自定义 Hooks](/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks)的最顶层调用。**你不能调用条件表达式、循环或其他嵌套函数内的 Hooks。Hooks 是函数，但将它们视为关于组件需求的无条件声明会很有帮助。你在组件顶部“使用”React 功能类似于在文件顶部“导入”模块的方式。
You can't call Hooks inside conditions, loops, or other nested functions. Hooks are functions, but it's helpful to think of them as unconditional declarations about your component's needs. You "use" React features at the top of your component similar to how you "import" modules at the top of your file.

</Gotcha>

### Anatomy of `useState`

当你调用 [`useState`](/reference/usestate) 时，你是在告诉 React 你想让这个组件记住一些东西：

```js
const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);
```

在这个例子里，你希望 React 记住 `index`。

> 惯例是将这对值命名为 `const [thing, setThing]`。你可以将其命名为任何你喜欢的名称，但约定俗成能使跨项目的事情更容易理解。
You could name it anything you like, but conventions make things easier to understand across projects.

`useState` 的唯一参数是 state 变量的**初始值**。在这个例子中，`index` 的初始值被`useState(0)`设置为 `0`。
The only argument to `useState` is the **initial value** of your state variable. In this example, the `index`'s initial value is set to `0` with `useState(0)`. 

每次你的组件渲染时，`useState` 都会给你一个包含两个值的数组：

1. **state 变量** (`index`) 与你存储的值。
2. **state setter 函数** (`setIndex`) 可以更新 state 变量并触发 React 重新渲染组件。

以下是实际发生的情况：
Here's how that happens in action:

```js
const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);
```

1. **组件进行第一次渲染。** 因为你将 `0` 作为 `index` 的初始值传递给 `useState`，它将返回 `[0, setIndex]`。 React 记住 `0` 是最新的 state 值。
2. **你更新了 state。**当用户点击按钮时，它会调用 `setIndex(index + 1)`。 `index` 是 `0`，所以它是 `setIndex(1)`。这告诉 React 现在记住 `index` 是 `1` 并触发另一个渲染。
3. **组件进行第二次渲染。** React 仍然看到 `useState(0)`，但是因为 React *记住* 了你将 `index` 设置为了 `1`，它将返回 `[1, setIndex]`。
4. 以此类推！

## Giving a component multiple state variables

你可以在一个组件中拥有任意多种类型的 state 变量。该组件有两个 state 变量，一个数字 `index` 和一个点击 “Show Details” 会切换的布尔值 `showMore`：
You can have as many state variables of as many types as you like in one component. This component has two state variables, a number `index` and a boolean `showMore` that's toggled when you click "Show details":

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState } from 'react';
import { sculptureList } from './data.js';

export default function Gallery() {
  const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);
  const [showMore, setShowMore] = useState(false);

  function handleNextClick() {
    setIndex(index + 1);
  }

  function handleMoreClick() {
    setShowMore(!showMore);
  }

  let sculpture = sculptureList[index];
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={handleNextClick}>
        Next
      </button>
      <h2>

      <button onClick={handleMoreClick}>

      </button>
      {showMore && <p>{sculpture.description}</p>}

如果它们不相关，那么存在多个 state 变量是一个好主意，例如本例中的 `index` 和 `showMore`。但是，如果你发现经常同时更改两个 state 变量，那么最好将它们合并为一个。例如，如果你有一个包含多个字段的表单，那么拥有一个值为对象的 state 变量比每个字段对应一个 state 变量更方便。 [选择 state 结构](/learn/choosing-the-state-structure)在这方面有更多提示。

<DeepDive title="How does React know which state to return?">

你可能已经注意到，`useState` 在调用时没有任何关于它引用的是*哪个* state 变量的信息。没有传递给 `useState` 的“标识符”，它是如何知道要返回哪个 state 变量呢？它是否依赖于解析函数之类的魔法？答案是否定的。

相反，为了使语法更简洁，**在同一组件的每次渲染中，Hooks 都依托于一个稳定的调用顺序**。这在实践中很有效，因为如果你遵循上面的规则（“只在顶层调用 Hooks”），Hooks 将始终以相同的顺序被调用。此外，[linter 插件](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react-hooks)也可以捕获大多数错误。

在内部，React 为每个组件保存了一个包含 state 对的数组。它还维护当前对的索引，在渲染之前将其设置为“0”。每次调用 useState 时，React 都会为你提供下一个 state 对并增加索引。你可以在文章 [React Hooks: 不是魔法，只是数组](https://medium.com/@ryardley/react-hooks-not-magic-just-arrays-cd4f1857236e)中阅读有关此机制的更多信息。
Internally, React holds an array of state pairs for every component. It also maintains the current pair index, which is set to `0` before rendering. Each time you call `useState`, React gives you the next state pair and increments the index.

这个例子**不使用 React**，但它让你了解 `useState` 在内部是如何工作的：

<Sandpack>

```js index.js active
let componentHooks = [];
let currentHookIndex = 0;

// How useState works inside React (simplified).
function useState(initialState) {
  let pair = componentHooks[currentHookIndex];
  if (pair) {
    // This is not the first render,
    // so the state pair already exists.
    // Return it and prepare for next Hook call.
    currentHookIndex++;
    return pair;
  }

  // This is the first time we're rendering,
  // so create a state pair and store it.
  pair = [initialState, setState];

## State is isolated and private

State 是屏幕上组件实例内部的状态。换句话说，**如果你渲染同一个组件两次，每个副本都会有完全隔离的 state！**改变其中一个不会影响另一个。

在这个例子中，之前的 `Gallery` 组件以同样的逻辑被渲染了两次。试着点击每个画廊内的按钮。你会注意到它们的 state 是相互独立的：

<Sandpack>

  );
}

```

```js Gallery.js
import { useState } from 'react';
import { sculptureList } from './data.js';

export default function Gallery() {
  const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);
  const [showMore, setShowMore] = useState(false);

  function handleNextClick() {
    setIndex(index + 1);
  }

  function handleMoreClick() {
    setShowMore(!showMore);
  }

  let sculpture = sculptureList[index];
  return (
    <section>

</Sandpack>

这就是 state 与你可能在模块顶部声明的常规变量不同的原因。 State 与特定的函数调用或代码中的位置无关，但它只作用于屏幕上的某块特定区域。你渲染了两个 `<Gallery />` 组件，所以它们的 state 是分开存储的。
but it's "local" to the specific place on the screen.

还要注意 `Page` 组件“不知道”关于 `Gallery` state 的任何信息，甚至不知道它是否有任何 state。与 props 不同，**state 完全私有于声明它的组件**。父组件无法更改它。这使你可以向任何组件添加或删除 state，而不会影响其余组件。

如果你希望两个画廊保持其 states 同步怎么办？在 React 中执行此操作的正确方法是从子组件中*删除* state 并将其添加到离它们最近的共享父组件中。接下来的几节将专注于组织单个组件的 state，但我们将在[组件间共享 state](/learn/sharing-state-between-components)中回到这个主题。

<Recap>

* 当一个组件需要在多次渲染间“记住”某些信息时使用 state 变量。
* State 变量是通过调用 `useState` Hook 来声明的。
* Hooks 是以 `use` 开头的特殊函数。它们让你“连接”到像 state 这样的 React 特性。
* Hooks 可能会让你想起 imports：它们需要被无条件调用。调用 Hooks，包括 `useState`，仅在组件或另一个 Hook 的顶层有效。
* `useState` Hook 返回一对值：当前 state 和更新它的函数。
* 你可以拥有多个 state 变量。在内部，React 按顺序匹配它们。
* State 是组件私有的。如果你在两个地方渲染它，则每个副本都有独属于自己的 state。
* Hooks are special functions that start with `use`. They let you "hook into" React features like state.
* Hooks might remind you of imports: they need to be called unconditionally. Calling Hooks, including `useState`, is only valid at the top level of a component or another Hook.

</Recap>



<Challenges>

### Complete the gallery

当你在最后一个雕塑上按“下一步”时，代码会崩溃。修复逻辑以防止崩溃。你可以尝试在事件处理函数中添加额外的逻辑，或在无法执行操作时禁用掉按钮。
When you press "Next" on the last sculpture, the code crashes. Fix the logic to prevent the crash. You may do this by adding extra logic to event handler or by disabling the button when the action is not possible.

修复崩溃后，添加一个显示上一个雕塑的“previous”按钮。它也不应该在第一个雕塑里发生崩溃。
After fixing the crash, add a "Previous" button that shows the previous sculpture. It shouldn't crash on the first sculpture.

This adds a guarding condition inside both event handlers and disables the buttons when needed:

  let hasNext = index < sculptureList.length - 1;

  function handlePrevClick() {

      setIndex(index - 1);
    }
  }

  function handleNextClick() {
    if (hasNext) {
      setIndex(index + 1);
    }
  }

  function handleMoreClick() {
    setShowMore(!showMore);
  }

  let sculpture = sculptureList[index];

注意 `hasPrev` 和 `hasNext` 是如何*同时* 作用于返回的 JSX 和事件处理函数中的！这种简便模式之所以有效，是因为事件处理函数["闭包"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures)了渲染时声明的任何变量。
Notice how `hasPrev` and `hasNext` are used *both* for the returned JSX and inside the event handlers! This handy pattern works because event handler functions ["close over"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures) any variables declared while rendering.

### Fix stuck form inputs

当你输入字段时，什么也没有出现。这就像输入值被空字符串给“卡住”了。第一个 `<input>` 的 `value` 设置为始终匹配 `firstName` 变量，第二个 `<input>` 的 `value` 设置为始终匹配 `lastName` 变量。这是对的。两个输入框都有 `onChange` 事件处理函数，它尝试根据最新的用户输入（`e.target.value`）更新变量。但是，变量似乎并没有在重新渲染时“记住”它们的值。通过使用 state 变量来解决此问题。

<Sandpack>

```js
export default function Form() {
  let firstName = '';
  let lastName = '';

  function handleFirstNameChange(e) {
    firstName = e.target.value;
  }

  function handleLastNameChange(e) {
    lastName = e.target.value;
  }

  function handleReset() {
    firstName = '';
    lastName = '';
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={e => e.preventDefault()}>
      <input
        placeholder="First name"
        value={firstName}
        onChange={handleFirstNameChange}
      />
      <input
        placeholder="Last name"
        value={lastName}
        onChange={handleLastNameChange}
      />
      <h1>Hi, {firstName} {lastName}</h1>
      <button onClick={handleReset}>Reset</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

```css 
h1 { margin-top: 10px; }
```

</Sandpack>

<Solution>

首先，从 React 导入 `useState`。然后用 `useState` 声明的 state 变量替换 `firstName` 和 `lastName`。最后，用 `setFirstName(...)` 替换每个 `firstName = ...` 赋值，并对 `lastName` 做同样的事情。不要忘记更新 `handleReset`，以便重置按钮。

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Form() {
  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('');
  const [lastName, setLastName] = useState('');

  function handleFirstNameChange(e) {
    setFirstName(e.target.value);
  }

  function handleLastNameChange(e) {
    setLastName(e.target.value);
  }

  function handleReset() {
    setFirstName('');
    setLastName('');
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={e => e.preventDefault()}>
      <input
        placeholder="First name"
        value={firstName}
        onChange={handleFirstNameChange}
      />
      <input
        placeholder="Last name"
        value={lastName}
        onChange={handleLastNameChange}
      />
      <h1>Hi, {firstName} {lastName}</h1>
      <button onClick={handleReset}>Reset</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

```css 
h1 { margin-top: 10px; }

### Fix a crash

这是一个小表单，用于让用户留下一些反馈。当反馈被提交时，它应该显示一条感谢信息。但是，现在它会发生崩溃并显示错误消息“渲染的 hooks 比预期的少”。你能发现错误并修复它吗？
Here is a small form that is supposed to let the user leave some feedback. When the feedback is submitted, it's supposed to display a thank-you message. However, it crashes with an error message saying "Rendered fewer hooks than expected". Can you spot the mistake and fix it?

<Hint>

对于 Hooks 在什么地方被调用，有任何限制吗？这个组件是否违反了任何规则？
Are there any limitations on _where_ Hooks may be called? Does this component break any rules?

</Hint>

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function FeedbackForm() {
  const [isSent, setIsSent] = useState(false);
  if (isSent) {
    return <h1>Thank you!</h1>;
  } else {
    const [message, setMessage] = useState('');
    return (
      <form onSubmit={e => {
        e.preventDefault();
        alert(`Sending: "${message}"`);
        setIsSent(true);
      }}>
        <textarea
          placeholder="Message"
          value={message}
          onChange={e => setMessage(e.target.value)}
        />
        <br />
        <button type="submit">Send</button>
      </form>
    );
  }
}
```

</Sandpack>

<Solution>

Hooks 只能在组件函数的顶层调用。这里，第一个 `isSent` 定义遵循这个规则，但是 `message` 定义嵌套在一个条件语句中。将其移出条件语句以解决问题：
Hooks can only be called at the top level of the component function. Here, the first `isSent` definition follows this rule, but the `message` definition is nested in a condition. Move it out of the condition to fix the issue:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function FeedbackForm() {
  const [isSent, setIsSent] = useState(false);
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');

  if (isSent) {
    return <h1>Thank you!</h1>;
  } else {
    return (
      <form onSubmit={e => {
        e.preventDefault();
        alert(`Sending: "${message}"`);
        setIsSent(true);
      }}>
        <textarea
          placeholder="Message"
          value={message}
          onChange={e => setMessage(e.target.value)}
        />
        <br />
        <button type="submit">Send</button>
      </form>
    );
  }
}
```

</Sandpack>

请记住，必须在条件语句外并且始终以相同的顺序调用 Hook！
Remember, Hooks must be called unconditionally and always in the same order!


你还可以删除不必要的`else` 分支以减少嵌套。但要保证对 Hooks 的所有调用都发生在*第一个 `return` 前，这很重要。

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function FeedbackForm() {
  const [isSent, setIsSent] = useState(false);
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');

  if (isSent) {
    return <h1>Thank you!</h1>;
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={e => {
      e.preventDefault();
      alert(`Sending: "${message}"`);
      setIsSent(true);
    }}>
      <textarea
        placeholder="Message"
        value={message}
        onChange={e => setMessage(e.target.value)}
      />
      <br />
      <button type="submit">Send</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

</Sandpack>

尝试移动第二个 `useState` 调用到 `if` 条件之后，并注意这如何再次破坏了它。
Try moving the second `useState` call after the `if` condition and notice how this breaks it again.

通常，以上类型的错误都会由 [`eslint-plugin-react-hooks`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react-hooks) linter 规则捕获。如果在本地调试错误代码时没有看到错误，则需要在构建工具的配置文件中进行设置。

### Remove unnecessary state

当按钮被点击时，这个例子应该询问用户的名字，然后显示一个 alert 欢迎他们。你尝试使用 state 来保存名字，但由于某种原因，它始终显示“Hello, ！”。


要修复此代码，请删除不必要的 state 变量。（我们将在稍后讨论 [为什么以上代码不起作用](/learn/troubleshooting-state-updates#setting-state-does-not-update-variables)。）
(We will discuss about [why this didn't work](/learn/troubleshooting-state-updates#setting-state-does-not-update-variables) later.)

你能解释为什么这个 state 变量是不必要的吗？

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function FeedbackForm() {
  const [name, setName] = useState('');

  function handleClick() {
    setName(prompt('What is your name?'));
    alert(`Hello, ${name}!`);
  }

  return (
    <button onClick={handleClick}>
      Greet
    </button>
  );
}
```

</Sandpack>

<Solution>

以下是一个使用声明于需要她的函数中的一般 `name` 变量的固定版本：
Here is a fixed version that uses a regular `name` variable declared in the function that needs it:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function FeedbackForm() {
  function handleClick() {
    const name = prompt('What is your name?');
    alert(`Hello, ${name}!`);
  }

  return (
    <button onClick={handleClick}>
      Greet
    </button>
  );
}
```

</Sandpack>

State 变量仅用于在组件重渲染时保存信息。在单个事件处理函数中，一般变量就足够了。当一般变量运行良好时，不要引入 state 变量。
